## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Arduino IDE or PlatformIO for firmware development
- KiCAD for PCB design viewing/editing
- Basic knowledge of microcontrollers (Arduino, ESP32, etc.)

### Quick Start
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GIU-F1Tenth/racebrain-modules.git
   cd racebrain-modules
   ```

2. Choose the module you want to work with:
   - For lap timing: `cd lap_timer/`
   - For common utilities: `cd common/`

3. Follow the specific README instructions in each module directory
